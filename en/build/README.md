 _1. PAY ATTENTION WHEN FOLDING THE CARDBOARD. IF FOLDED WRONG WAY, YOU WILL NEED GLUE TO FIX IT._
 
 _2. GET READY TO GET DIRTY. LASERCUT CARDBOARD LEAVES BLACK SMUDGES ON YOUR HANDS._

(We recommend wipe every part with paper tissue.)

### Video-manual
Here is the original video-manual to build TJBot. You can follow it. The only major difference is in connecting the LED. TJBotCZ uses traditional RGB LED which is just resting on a platform below the top part (the head) - see the photos below. To fix the LED we rocommend using Blue Tack or similar sticky gum.

**Be careful:**
* fold cardboard the right way (on some parts there is instruction "fold up" or "fold down" (ohni dol≈Ø) - so better safe than sorry :)
* stick to the flow in the video manual so that ou do not have to re-assemble it later
  * especially when connecting the legs for stability
  * inserting the servo

### So what is different about TJBotCZ?

1. Part holding the speaker.
2. RGB LED

Good walkthrough of building TJBot is available also here:

For longer endurance we recommend stick some parts with glue-gun. Especially legs and parts holding the Raspberry Pi on the bottom.

### Connecting the hardware

Picture below shows all the connectivity you might need for TJBot:
* power adapter
* HDMI for connecting monitor
* camera
* jack audio output for speaker
* ethernet connecting to internet (in case you do not use WiFi)
* USB slots for microfone, mouse and keyboard
* pins on Raspberry Pi for connecting RGB LED and servo

**GPIO pins**

Peropherals to Raspberry Pi are connected over individual pins. Here is the legend to all the pins:

**Connecting servo to GPIO pins**

Servo uses 3 pins:
* 5V power / + (physical pin 02)
* ground / - (physical pin 14)
* GPIO 7 for commands (physical pin 26) - can be configured (config.js - see bring-to-life)

**Connecting RGB LED to GPIO pins**

RGB LED uses 4 pins:
* ground / - (physical pin 09)
* GPIO 17 / R (physical pin 11) - can be configured (config.js - see bring-to-life)
* GPIO 27 / G (physical pin 13) - can be configured (config.js - see bring-to-life)
* GPIO 22 / B (physical pin 15) - can be configured (config.js - see bring-to-life)
